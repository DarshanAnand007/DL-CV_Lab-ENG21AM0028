Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs), are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons.

- Functions Used:

Each neuron computes its output using a non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.
The connections between neurons, called edges, transmit signals.
Neurons have weights that adjust during learning to increase or decrease signal strength.
Neurons may have a threshold, and a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.

-Layers:

Neurons are typically organized into layers.
Layers may perform different transformations on their inputs.
Signals travel from the input layer to the output layer, possibly traversing layers multiple times.


The output looks like :

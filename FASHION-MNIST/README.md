CNN Performance Analysis on Fashion MNIST Dataset
Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The code is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, a popular deep learning library.

Key Components
CNN Model: The CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras. It consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flattening layer, and fully connected layers.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset, Fashion MNIST, is loaded and preprocessed. Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Training: The model is trained on the training set using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy metrics are calculated.

Visualization: The training history (accuracy and loss) is visualized using matplotlib. Additionally, predictions are made on test images, and one example prediction is displayed.
